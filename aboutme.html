                <p>Hello! My name is Raquel Rubio, and <span class="bold">I am a creative, communicative, curious and empathetic person,
                    passionate about design as well as psychology and human behavior.</span>

                    After more than 5 years of experience in Graphic Design and Photography, I decided to study UX/UI
                    Design at Ironhack. This change was given by the necessity to put people back at the center of my
                    work, because this had evolved to a point where I was creating graphics non-stop, without thinking
                    about the user or a real utility. I've found myself working with no other purpose than to reach a
                    maximum number of weekly compositions. Fortunately, now I am rebuilding myself and I have changed
                    the empty and repeatable campaigns for: <span class="bold">product design, user experience, UX research, usability,
                    interactions, wireframes or prototypes, and adapted them to the users and their way of life, the
                    world and the last technologies.</span>

                    In the future I would like to find a multidisciplinary company that is ethical with its products and
                    work methods, that values ​​teamwork and good labor relations. I am passionate about my work, and
                    I'm looking for a job where get involved and grow with each project.

                    Now you know me a little better, do you want to talk?
                    I will be happy to know each other better.</p>
